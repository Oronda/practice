Virtualization is the usage of a single physical machine's hardware to run multiple virtual machines within it. This virtual machines are all using the hardware of the single machine. For each virtual machine, an ammount of processor(CPU), memory(RAM) and storage space is allocated. The total ammount of the CPU, RAM and storage that one is using on the virtual machine cannot exceed what is available on the physical hardware.

There are two types of virtualizastion software; type 1 and type 2 hypervisors. Type 1 is called a bare metal hypervisor while type 2 is called a hosted hypervisor.

Some of the common virtualization softwares include:
1. **Solar Winds Virtualization Manager.** This is among the best for monitoring virtuak machines. It helps the team to gain insights into the usage, capacity and performance of the virtualized infrastructure. It has features like performance monitoring, capacity planning and snapshot management.
2. **Oracle VM virtual box.** It enables users to set up multiple virtual machines on a single physiscal hardware which can be used simultaneously. It has features like multi-screen resolution, USB device support, guest multiprocessing.
3. **Windows Virtual PC.** This software helps one to create and install a virtual machine on windows 7 and subsequent OS. It has features like seamless application launch, provides support for multithreading and improved stability and performance. 
4. **V2 cloud** has features like browser, accessiblity and web client. It has a fast performance and tgood technical support.
5. **VMware** is used for Mac users. It is advantageous because it can work with cloud and no reboot is required.
6. **Microsoft hyper V** has features like hardware virtualization, can run multiple virtuaal machines and it supports a cloud-based platform.
7. Other platforms include **Citrix**, **Amazon**, **QEMU**, **RedHat**, **Boot Camp** among others.

There are different types of virtualization. They include:
* Cloud
* Desktop
* Server
* Storage
* Application

The difference between virtualization and containerization is that
